## 2 - Hello visitor

This app takes the input from the text input field and outputs your input in realtime to the screen. The input should be your name because it’s cool seeing your name on a page. 
This is likely the first time you’ll see how cool React really is.

## 3 - Fizz Buzz

Everyone's favorite junior developer interview question.

“Can you build FizzBuzz? Show me!”

Don’t get frustrated. This is quite a bit more challenging. You’ll need to create increment and decrement buttons.

## 5 - Camper Leaderboard

For the final challenge you will build a leaderboard app. You will need to access the Leaderboard data using the provided endpoints. You will need to grab data for
 pretty much every React app you build so this one is important.

Here is the link to the FreeCodeCamp challenge. [Build a Camper Leaderboard](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard).

Pro-tip: Use Axios to perform your GET requests to access the Leaderboard data.
