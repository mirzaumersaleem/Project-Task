# Responsive Layout

Create a layout that looks like this:

![dashboard](blob/master/interview_fe/q2/dashboard.png)

The images are provided in the `images` folder. Preferably, but not required, use CSS flexbox or CSS grids. This should be responsive on mobile at a basic level as well. Remove the sidebar and line up all the boxes in one column for the mobile version.
